Window.java is the file you want to run, if you would like to actually run the visualization.

To run a different algorithm, just go into the main method and change the function its calling.
Its pretty easy to see once you get there.

Feel free to mess around with the internals.
There are quite a few functins inside Rectangle.java and RectangleList.java that I figured I would need, and didn't.
Someone else might find a way to make it better that way.

Not everything was thought out ahead of time, so you might notice that some of the naming is done in a way that is not logically consistent with everything else.
And is is not really commented out enough.

Or in QuickSort, I just had it choose a pivot value randomly and you'll notice that it actually can be quite inefficient sometimes.
